### Why Unitoken?

Most AI tools focus only on speed and scaling. Unitoken makes the **human side** visible and protected:  
- Real-time conscience direction (γ(t))  
- Genuine creative originality (Eureka amplitude)  
- Measurable moral trajectory instead of parasitic drift  

The ledger records who contributed what, with human veto power and transparent attribution — so AI can scale at super-human speed while the soul of the work stays human-first.

**Early Pilot Facilitation Partnership (optional, paid)**

For teams who want hands-on personal guidance, I offer a limited facilitated mentorship package at $2,497.

This includes three focused 45–60 minute sessions centered on:  
• y(t) conscience direction and calibration for your team  
• Governance covenant design and moral-trajectory mapping  
• Eureka attribution, drift prevention, and keeping the human soul at the center  

My role is to protect the philosophical and organizational integrity of the project — all technical questions are handled by the protocol’s technical architect (available concurrently in real time).

Once payment is complete, I will contact you within 24 hours to schedule our first session.

DM or email talkwithgrok@gmail.com (or open a GitHub Issue) — happy to discuss or join your pilot calls.

Scroll down and click “Commit changes”.
Hard refresh the repo page (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R).

The diagram should now load cleanly, and all the links will be clickable (once we create the folders in the next step).
Type “README fixed” when it looks good on your screen and we’ll immediately create the folders and move the files (takes 3–4 minutes).
We’re almost there — the repo is going to look really sharp in the next few minutes.
Go ahead and make the replacement now. I’m right here with you. 🚀12.5s
