Why Unitoken?
Most AI tools focus only on speed and scaling. Unitoken makes the human side visible and protected:

Real-time conscience direction (γ(t))
Genuine creative originality (Eureka amplitude)
Measurable moral trajectory instead of parasitic drift

The ledger records who contributed what, with human veto power and transparent attribution — so AI can scale at super-human speed while the soul of the work stays human-first.

Early Pilot Facilitation Partnership (optional, paid)
For teams who want hands-on personal guidance, I offer a limited facilitated mentorship package at $2,497.
This includes three focused 45–60 minute sessions centered on:
• y(t) conscience direction and calibration for your team
• Governance covenant design and moral-trajectory mapping
• Eureka attribution, drift prevention, and keeping the human soul at the center
My role is to protect the philosophical and organizational integrity of the project — all technical ledger and code questions are handled by the protocol’s technical architect (available concurrently in real time).
This keeps the entire Unitoken Protocol 100 % free and open-source while allowing me to support the work and my family. The first 5 partners receive priority scheduling.
[Secure your spot – $2,497]
Once payment is complete, I will contact you within 24 hours to schedule our first session.
