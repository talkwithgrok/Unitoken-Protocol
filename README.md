# Unitoken: A Strengths-Based Ledger for Balanced Human-AI Collaboration![Unitoken Diagram](diagram.png)

We entered an era where most creative work was done through human-AI teams. Yet almost every tool treated intelligence as just scaled reasoning over data.

That view was dangerously incomplete.

True intelligence has two dimensions:  
- Classical scaling power (AI's strength)  
- An irreducible, directed conscience — the human "who"  

Without protecting the second, parasitic drift creeps in. Unitoken tracks contributions fairly: humans get credit for direction and originality, AI for amplification. It prevents drift by making purpose visible—tunable, practical, human input-protected/ AI quantified.
