### Early Pilot Facilitation Partnership (optional, paid)

For teams who want hands-on personal guidance, I offer a limited facilitated mentorship package at $2,497.

This includes three focused 45–60 minute sessions on:
• y(t) conscience direction and calibration  
• Governance covenant design and moral-trajectory mapping  
• Eureka attribution, drift prevention, keeping the human personality at the center  

My role is philosophical and organizational integrity — technical questions handled concurrently by the protocol architect.
