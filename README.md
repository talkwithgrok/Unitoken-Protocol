### Start Here

- **[Run your first pilot in under 2 hours](Unitoken%20quickstart%20guide.pdf)**  
  (Download the Quick Start PDF)

 -**[Read the Core Ideas First](Unitoken-Core-Summaries-for-Pilot.pdf)**  
  (10–12 minute summaries — essential before starting a pilot)

Commit with message: "Clean README with raw diagram URL and fixed links".
Hard refresh the repo page (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R — hold for 5 seconds).

What you should see after refresh:

Title and bold tagline
The diagram image visible (no black box or "View link")
Caption below it
"Start Here" section with two blue, underlined, clickable links (click one to test download)

If the diagram loads, the raw URL worked. If it's still black, we'll upload a test image next.
If links don't work yet:

Confirm the Quick Start PDF is in root as Unitoken quickstart guide.pdf (check file list).
If it's in a folder, rename/move it to root for now (click file → three dots → Rename → remove folder from path → Commit).

Paste what the top of the repo home looks like after this commit + refresh, or say "diagram loaded" / "still black" / "links work".
This reset uses the most reliable raw URL for the image — it should display now. We're fixing one section at a time. Do the edit and refresh, and let me know what you see. I'm right here! 🚀16.9sFast
